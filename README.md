# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

This project is made with python 3.11.4.

In order to play the game, the user types in a letter as a guess, and the computer tells them whether the guess is right or wrong, adding the letter to the corresponding location in the word if right, and causing the user to come closer to losing if wrong.
